The prompt box is ~180px wide, so it extends from x=-15 to x=165 in world space, clipping the left edge. Fix by adding a promptXOffset to the StationVisual interface (similar to promptYOffset) and setting it to shift the prompt rightward so it doesn't clip. Alternatively, just set the prompt x offset for the door so the left edge starts at ~x=10 world space.\n\n2. **Position over door**: Change promptYOffset from 20 (below station, overlapping player) to a negative value that positions the prompt over the door graphic itself (the door runs from y=95 to y=200).

{"id":"hacking-game-zvf","title":"Add code-length milestone overlay to Code Breaker at 10/15/20 length","description":"Follow the Botnet Defense milestone pattern (BotnetDefenseGame.ts checkSurvivalMilestones and BotnetDefenseScene.ts milestone overlay) to add milestones to Code Breaker.\n\nIn CodeBreakerGame.ts:\n1. Add CODE_LENGTH_MILESTONE_THRESHOLDS = [10, 15, 20]\n2. Add _triggeredMilestones: Set\u003cnumber\u003e field, reset in start/resetState\n3. In handleCodeComplete(), after incrementing _currentCodeLength, check if the NEW code length matches a threshold. If so and not already triggered this session and not in global store survivalMilestones, pause and emit 'milestone-reached' with {thresholdValue: N}.\n\nIn CodeBreakerScene.ts:\n1. Add showingMilestone flag and milestoneOverlay container\n2. Listen for 'milestone-reached' event\n3. Show overlay: 'REPUTATION EARNED' / 'LENGTH X CODE BROKEN' / flavor text / '+10 Renown/min'\n4. Any key/click dismisses: call store.getState().achieveSurvivalMilestone(thresholdValue), resume game\n5. Block game updates while showingMilestone is true (add to existing showingResults guard)\n6. Add milestone overlay cleanup to onDestroy()\n\nNOTE: Use the existing achieveSurvivalMilestone store action. Use threshold values like 1010, 1015, 1020 (or some namespace) to avoid colliding with Code Runner wall thresholds (15, 30, 45) and Botnet time thresholds (300000+). Or use string-like encoding: e.g. store the raw length values 10, 15, 20 — these won't collide with Code Runner's 15 since achieveSurvivalMilestone is idempotent. Actually 15 WILL collide with Code Runner's 15. Use offset values like 10000+length (10010, 10015, 10020) to namespace them.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"me@stephenmccray.com","created_at":"2026-02-01T20:51:48.640297-08:00","created_by":"Stephen McCray","updated_at":"2026-02-01T21:09:04.46127-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-01T21:09:04.46127-08:00","close_reason":"Validated: Code length milestones at 10/15/20 with namespaced store values (10010/10015/10020).
